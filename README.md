Hey there 👋
</h1>

***

I'm Varun. No idea what you're looking for here, but here's some cool stuff anyway.

<h2>
Bio
</h2>

***

I am a med student, so I'm obviously not going to be very active here. However, I've always had a passion for programming, and am currently using and proficient at Docker and K8s.

I've been an avid Python programmer since March 2016, and I rather enjoy the language. I've also dabbled in lower level languages like Rust, C++, and C.

Kotlin/Java are hobbies, but more small-time (no, not Android welp).

<h2>Work/Projects</h2>

***
A number of my projects are currently closed source until I'm at a stage where I
~~won't be roasted~~ am comfortable with their quality, so not much of a portfolio here,
but I promise I'm good at this stuff.

I'm looking to contribute on C/Java/Python projects, if you want some bad jokes in your commit messages.

As a fun demonstration of what I can do, this README *dynamically updates* using GitHub Actions every hour.
