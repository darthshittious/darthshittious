Hey there üëã
</h1>

***

I'm Varun. No idea what you're looking for here, but here's some cool stuff anyway.

<h2>
Bio
</h2>

***

I am a med student, so I'm obviously not going to be very active here. However, I've always had a passion for programming, and so, here I am.

I've been an avid Python programmer since March 2016, and I rather enjoy the language. I've also dabbled in lower level languages like Rust and C.
I'm learning Go and am not quite proficient at it, but I do catch on quick.

Kotlin/Java are hobbies, but more small-time (no, not Android welp).

More recently, I've ventured into web development. I don't have the artistic eye that would make one good at frontend stuff, but I try.
I'm really beginning to enjoy Typescript and Svelte.

I am also a professional pianist/arranger/composer/music producer. (The main reason I still have a Windows PC is to run Cubase and Ableton Live, and I can't afford to maintain a Mac). 

My daily driver is Arch Linux with KDE Plasma (that's right I use Arch with a DE). My text editor of choice is usually one of Jetbrains, which is mostly because I have gotten used to it, having gotten an early access license for free.
When I want something more minimal in case I want to multitask, I usually go the other extreme and use Neovim. I also use ST4 or VS Code when I find Jetbrains too annoying.

<h2>Work/Projects</h2>

***
A number of my projects are currently closed source until I'm at a stage where I
~~won't be roasted~~ am comfortable with their quality, so not much of a portfolio here,
but I promise I'm good at this stuff.

I'm looking to contribute on Rust/Python projects, if you want some bad jokes in your commit messages.
