# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--![Varun's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=darthshittious&theme=dark)-->
I'm Varun. No idea why you're looking here, but here goes

## Bio

I'm a med student, so I'm obviously not going to be very active here. However, I've always had a passion for programming, and am currently using and proficient at Docker and K8s.

I've been an avid Python programmer since March 2016 and I rather enjoy the language. I've also dabbled in lower level languages like Rust, C++, and C.

Kotlin/Java are hobbies, but more small time (no, not Android welp).

## Work/Projects

A number of my projects are currently closed source until I'm at a stage where I ~~won't be roasted~~ am comfortable with their quality, so not much of a portfolio here,
but I promise I'm good at this stuff.

I'm looking to contribute on C/Java/Python projects, if you want some bad jokes in your commit messages.
